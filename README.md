## Working with Project Boards.
* The GitHub Projects feature serves as a tool for organizing and monitoring work, enabling the creation of boards with columns that represent different stages or statuses of tasks
* Kanban boards are visual instruments that implement the Kanban methodology, utilizing columns to represent work stages and cards to represent individual tasks or stories
*	Both GitHub Projects and Kanban boards provide a visual depiction of tasks, making it easy to grasp the progress and status in a concise manner.
*	Collaboration and transparency are fostered as team members can view task statuses, assignees, and engage in discussions or comments.
*	Prioritization and focus are enhanced by structuring stories, ensuring alignment and boosting productivity.
*	Flexibility and adaptability are offered, allowing customization of workflows, columns, and labels to cater to specific project requirements.

## Possible Applications
Here are the key points about how GitHub Projects and Kanban can help our group in future projects:
* __Organization:__ GitHub Projects and Kanban provide a structured framework for organizing and tracking tasks, allowing us to have a clear overview of the project and effectively manage and prioritize tasks.
* __Visualization:__ Both tools offer a visual representation of tasks and their progress, making it easy for team members to understand the status of each task and identify any bottlenecks or areas needing attention.
* __Collaboration:__ GitHub Projects and Kanban boards facilitate collaboration among team members by providing a centralized platform for sharing information, assigning tasks, and discussing issues. This promotes better coordination and communication within the group.
* __Transparency and accountability:__ These tools promote transparency by making tasks visible to all team members, along with their status and assigned owners. This fosters accountability and ensures that everyone is aware of their responsibilities and progress.
* __Streamlined workflow:__ Kanban's focus on limiting work in progress helps maintain a steady flow of tasks, reducing multitasking and increasing productivity. By setting appropriate work in progress limits, you can optimize your workflow.
* __Adaptability and continuous improvement:__ GitHub Projects and Kanban boards are highly customizable, allowing you to tailor them to fit your project's specific needs. This flexibility enables continuous improvement and adjustment based on the lessons learned from previous group projects.
